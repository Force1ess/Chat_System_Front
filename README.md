# Chat System

### Mainly used Vue and Electron
#### It is just a frontside work
#### Which means it cannot work without my friend's work if you want to chat with other people
##### Find corresponding code endside code at my friend [puellaquae](https://github.com/Puellaquae/Chat)
1. You should install electron at the folder you just download
* npm install electron --save-dev
2. Then run it!
* npm start
* then you can see this work
##### If you want to chat with othersï¼Œ run my friend's code before this

### Screenshot:

* When you register and log in, remember use your ID given by prompt, that's important
