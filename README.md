# Chat_System_Front
### Mainly used vue and electron
#### It is just a frontside work
#### Which means it cannot work without my friend's work if you want to chat with other people
##### Find corresponding code endside code at my friend [puellaquae](https://github.com/Puellaquae/Chat)
1. You should install electron at the folder you just download
* npm install electron --save-dev
2. npm start
* then you can see this work
* If you want to chat with others:
##### run my friend's code befor this
