Chat System

### Mainly used Vue and Electron
#### It is just a frontside work
#### Which means it cannot work without my friend's work if you want to chat with other people
##### Find corresponding code endside code at my friend [puellaquae](https://github.com/Puellaquae/Chat)
1. You should install electron at the folder you just download

##### run my friend's code before this
